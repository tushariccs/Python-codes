# An unsigned integer is a 32-bit non-negative integer(0 or positive numbers) in the range of 0 to 2^32-1
# A signed integer is a 32-bit integer in the range of -(2^31) = -2147483648 to (2^31) â€“ 1=2147483647 which contains positive or negative numbers.
# It is represented in two's complement notation. An unsigned integer is a 32-bit non-negative integer(0 or positive numbers) in the range of 0 to 2^32-1.
