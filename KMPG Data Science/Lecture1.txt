Package

If I want to perform any action.
    I should write the code for performing those actions
    I can cause use a package.(Inside every package there will lots of function)
    we just need to call that function to perform our analysis.
If I want to perform any analysis(get the descriptive of data).
Pandas,SKLEARN used for machine learning,Matplotlib for creating visualization dashboard.
Pandas are used for descriptive analysis

To import a package

Import packagename

Import packagename as p1
We need use multiple function so we need to import package.

                Package
    Module1                 Module2

Function1 Function2

The way we call function f1 as per up nomancliture os
p1.m1.function1 ->this will call function function1
p1.m1.Function2 ->this will call function function2
p1.m1.function3 ->this will call function function3


Pandas doesn't have concept of modules.
p1.f1 ->this will call function function1
